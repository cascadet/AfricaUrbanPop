Pop-ERL
==============================

This repo contains the code and final data for *Variability in urban population distributions across Africa* published in [Enivronmental Research Letters](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab2432). The gridded population data needed to produce the final urban settlement polygons is available from PopGrid.org and Esri Inc. We use:

-Global Human Settlment Layer Population Produce 2000 & 2015
-WorldPop 2000 & 2015
-ESRI Inc. Gridded Population of the World 2016
-LandScan 2015

For the final data as shape files, see XXX directory in the repo. 

The code may be buggy as I am slowly cleaning it. I will add file structure and data explainers in the next few weeks. Please ping me with any questions.
